title: SN2017jgh - A high-cadence complete shock cooling curve of a SN IIb with the <i>Kepler</i> telescope
subtitle: Clues to a dead star from its explosion
---

SN 2017jgh is a IIb supernova discovered as part of the <i>Kepler</i> K2 mission. The K2 mission is very useful for supernova study as it provides continuous, high cadence observations. These high cadence observations allowed us to capture the extremely early part of SN 2017jgh's lightcurve, known as the shock cooling curve.

Stars can be thought of as engines which turn matter into energy. A majority of stars burn hydrogen in their core, producing light and outward pressure. This outward pressure balances the inward pressure of gravity. Whilst these two types of pressure are in balance the star keeps burning. However, stars don't have infinite hydrogen and eventually they run out of fuel. When this happens the nuclear burning stops and there is nothing to balance the gravitational infall. As such, the star begins to collapse, falling in towards its core.

This core collapse has two effects, first the density and temperature of the core increases rapidly, secondly a shock wave forms, moving towards the core. When the shock wave hits the super dense core, it rebounds and begins to travel back through the exploding star. This shock is initially trapped behind optically thick material but as the progenitor star expands and explodes, the shock is freed and there is an brief flash of light as the trapped photons escape - this is the shock cooling curve.
