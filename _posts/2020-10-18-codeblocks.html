</p>
<p>
I plan to have a lot of code in these blogs, so I need to figure out how to display that code in a nicely formatted way.
</p>
<h2 class="sub">Raw HTML</h2>
<p>
Let's say I want to display a small, inline block of code. In order to do that I can use the <code class="inline">&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;</code> block. If instead I want a block of code, I can use some CSS and <code class="inline">classes</code> to get:
</p>
<code class="codeblock">
&lt;code class="codeblock" style="display:block;"&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code>
<p>
Now, we start to see some issues when I have multiple lines of code. For instance, the following snippet shows a Julia <code class="inline">for</code> loop.
</p>
<code class="codeblock">
for i in 1:10
    println(i^2)
end
</code>
<p>
However, the formatting of this snippet is all wrong! This is because HTML ignores tabs and character returns when formating text inside of a code block. To solve this, we can wrap our code blocks with <code class="inline">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code>. This tells HTML that the text inside is preformatted, so our webpage will display it as written. With <code class="inline">pre</code> our Julia code now looks like:
</p>
<pre>
<code class="codeblock">for i in 1:10
    println(i^2)
end
</code>
</pre>
</p>
<h2 class="sub">Jekyll, Liquid, and Rouge</h2>
<p>
So we now have a few different ways of displaying code, but they all have something in common - they're extremely ugly. In order to make these more readable we want to include some syntax highlighting. Luckily, since we are using Jekyll to create our webpage we have access to a syntax highlighter out of the box - Rouge.
</p>
<p>
Simply by wrapping our code in the following:
<pre>
<code class="codeblock">&#123;% highlight lang %&#125;
[code]
&#123;% endhighlight %&#125;
</code>
</pre>
where <code class="inline">lang</code> is the language. This will produce new HTML code with different parts of <code class="inline">[code]</code> in <code class="inline">spans</code> which can be easily manipulated via CSS. For instance, our piece of Julia code looks like this:
</p>
{% highlight julia linenos %}
# Here is some julia code
for i in 1:10
    println(i^2)
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now this is obviously much better than what we had before, and it was remarkably simple to produce! If you inspect the HTML of that codeblock you'll find that each distinct element (<code class="inline">for</code>, <code class="inline">i</code>, <code class="inline">in</code>, <code class="inline">1</code>, <code class="inline">:</code>, <code class="inline">10</code>, etc...) is wrapper in a <code class="inline">span</code> with a particular <code class="inline">class</code>. We can then use CSS to change the colour of each of those elements individually, leading us to syntax highlighting. Rouge make use of the same <code class="inline">span</code> classes as the popular python package pygment. As such, pygment themes can be used to theme Rouge syntax highlighting as well! I use an edited version of <a href="http://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes/languages/javascript.html">Monokai</a>.
</p>
<h2 class="sub">Line Numbers &amp; Language Display</h2>
<p>
Adding line numbers is quite easy, simply include <code class="inline">linenos</code> in the initial <code class="inline">highlight</code> call. This has a slight issue in that you are able to copy the line number, however that is easily fixed with the following CSS:
</p>
{% highlight css linenos %}
.highlight .lineno {
    /* ... */
    user-select: none; 
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Displaying the language is a little bit more difficult, I took some code from <a href="https://www.bytedude.com/jekyll-syntax-highlighting-and-line-numbers/">this blog</a> to produce the following SCSS code:
</p>
{% highlight scss linenos %}
figure.highlight {
    position: relative;
    pre {
        code {
            &[data-lang]::before {
                content: attr(data-lang);
                background-color: {{ site.dark_colour }};
                padding: 3px;
                display: flex;
                justify-content: flex-end;
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<h2 class="sub">Include &amp; relative include</h2>
<p>
The only issue thusfar is I've been writing out each of these code blocks by hand. This is fine when I've only got a few lines to write out, but as the size of the code I want to talk about increases, this gets more and more annoying.
</p>
<p>
Luckily Jekyll has us covered there too with the <code class="inline">&#123;% include filename %&#125;</code> and <code class="inline">&#123;% include_relative somedir/filename%&#125;</code> liquid commands. The former searches for <code class="inline">filename</code> within the <code class="inline">_includes</code> folder. The latter searches relative to the current file. This works quite well, allowing me to easily include code from local files. The following codeblock comes from <code class="inline">_includes</code>:
</p>
{% highlight julia linenos %}
{% include /codeblocks/test.jl %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
And this next one is placed directly in the <code class="inline">_posts</code> directory:
</p>
{% highlight julia linenos %}
{% include_relative test.jl %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Of course, this isn't perfect. There is one glaring issue with using <code class="inline">include</code> or <code class="inline">include_relative</code> which is that we are constricted to placing our local files either in <code class="inline">_include</code> or <code class="inline">_posts/somedir</code>. On the surface this doesn't seem too bad, however as soon as I try to have a link to either of these directories (perhaps because I want to share that file with you) I run in to a problem - the file doesn't exist!
</p>
<p>
The reason for this is thanks to how Jekyll and Liquid work to convert the <code class="inline">include</code> commands into actual html. In order to produce the codeblock from the file in <code class="inline">_includes</code> I wrote out the following:
</p>
{% highlight liquid linenos %}
{% raw %}
{% highlight julia linenos %}
{% include /codeblocks/test.jl %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
However, if you were to inspect that codeblock, you'd find a mess of <code class="inline">figure</code>, <code class="inline">pre</code>, <code class="inline">code</code>, and so on. Jekyll takes the Liquid code I've written and then produces a new file which is what you are reading right now, placing it in a new directory called <code class="inline">_site</code>. The issue with this is that the code I am including is not brought over to this new directory as any directory starting with an _ is ignored.
</p>
<p>
The other (notably minor) issue with using the <code class="inline">include</code> commands is the results of code. In order to show you the output of a codeblock I still need to write that out by hand.
</p>
<p>
I don't yet have a solution to either of these problems. My current train of thought is to start making use of javascript. If I can write my own code to include a file inside the <code class="inline">highlight</code> block, then I can store that file wherever I want. Additionally, javascript may be able to run code and collect the output to automatically be included in the codeblock. Once I come up with a solution, I'll create another post detailing it!
